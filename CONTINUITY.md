Goal (incl. success criteria):
- Use git for versioning of changes in this workspace.
- Maintain CONTINUITY.md updates each turn until the overall work is complete.

Constraints/Assumptions:
- Follow AGENTS/ledger instructions; keep non-ASCII only where required by source content.
- No destructive operations; avoid removing unrelated changes.
- Approval policy is never; proceed without asking for escalation.

Key decisions:
- Use git commits to record changes going forward.

State:
- In progress.

Done:
- Created CONTINUITY.md ledger.
- Rewrote AGENTS.md with the correct project-doc content (UTF-8).

Now:
- Check git status and repository state.

Next:
- Initialize git if needed and commit current changes.

Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
- Should I create an initial commit with current files if no git repo exists?

Working set (files/ids/commands):
- CONTINUITY.md
- AGENTS.md
- git status
